# CREDO
Credo Detector. Cosmic ray detection by Webcam. Source code in Lazarus Pascal. PC / Windows


CREDO is a project of Polish scientists from the institute of nuclear physics in Krakow.

I share the program I developed with the source code in Lazarus Pascal to capture cosmic ray particles using a webcam.

The analysis consists in catching a group of bright pixels among the noise of each frame.

The program should be adapted to your camera, because each has a different level of noise,
 different speed and many other parameters.
I tested it on Live! CamHD.

The first thing you should do is cover the lens. It's best to use black tape so that there is no light source.
Then start the program and wait. The effects are saved to BMP files in three different versions.

I encourage you to get to know the CREDO project and to develop the algorithm on other platforms according 
to your own will, imagination and fantasy;).

If you do not have an intenet camera, you can use a camera from your smartphone instead. How to do it? Here is the instruction :
